DemandTrigger is an end-to-end analytics engineering platform that empowers **consumers to make smarter purchasing decisions** and enables **brands to better understand customer price demand** through real-time price intelligence and historical analytics.

Consumers can track products across multiple online retailers, define personalized target prices, and receive automated notifications when products become affordable. Simultaneously, brands gain visibility into customer demand, target price trends, and retailer pricing dynamics to support pricing strategy, promotional campaigns, and inventory planning.

Built as a portfolio project, DemandTrigger demonstrates the complete analytics engineering lifecycle, from web scraping and ETL to semantic data modeling, automated notifications, business intelligence, and product thinking.

## Business Problem

Online shoppers often monitor products across multiple retailers before making a purchase, especially for high-value electronics and consumer goods. Comparing prices manually across websites is repetitive, time-consuming, and provides little visibility into historical pricing trends. As a result, consumers frequently miss opportunities to purchase products at their preferred price.

At the same time, brands and retailers have limited visibility into customer price expectations and purchasing intent. While purchase data reveals what customers bought, it does not capture what customers were willing to pay before making a purchase. This makes it difficult to identify pricing opportunities, optimize promotional campaigns, and understand demand across a product portfolio.

DemandTrigger addresses both challenges through a unified analytics platform that continuously tracks retailer prices, stores historical pricing data, enables personalized target-price monitoring, and transforms operational data into actionable consumer and brand intelligence.

## Solution Overview

DemandTrigger automates the complete price intelligence lifecycle by collecting product prices from multiple online retailers, validating and storing historical price data, evaluating user-defined target prices, and delivering insights through automated notifications and interactive business dashboards.

The platform is built around a modular data pipeline consisting of web scraping, ETL, semantic SQL modeling, analytics engineering, and business intelligence reporting.

This unified architecture serves two distinct user groups:

### Consumer

## Data Pipeline

DemandTrigger follows a layered analytics engineering pipeline that transforms raw retailer price data into actionable consumer and brand intelligence.

### 1. Data Collection

Retailer websites are scraped using modular Playwright-based scrapers. Each scraper is responsible for extracting standardized product information, including pricing, retailer details, and timestamps.

The modular scraper architecture allows new retailers to be integrated without impacting the remainder of the pipeline.

---

### 2. Raw Data Ingestion

Scraped records are first stored in the **`raw_scrape_data`** table, preserving the original retailer data before any transformations are applied.

This landing layer acts as the system's source of truth for all collected pricing information.

---

### 3. ETL Processing

The ETL pipeline validates scraped records, removes inconsistencies, and loads cleaned data into the historical **`price_history`** table.

This layer ensures that only high-quality data is used for downstream analytics while preserving complete historical price changes over time.

---

### 4. Serving Layer

A dedicated SQL view (`latest_prices`) exposes the most recent price available for every product-retailer combination.

This serving layer simplifies downstream processing by providing a single source for the latest product prices.

---

### 5. Business Processing

The latest prices are evaluated against active user watchlists and personalized target prices.

Whenever a product reaches or falls below a user's configured target price, the Notification Engine generates a price-drop alert and dispatches an HTML email notification through the SMTP service.

---

### 6. Semantic Analytics Layer

Pre-aggregated SQL views transform operational data into analytics-ready datasets optimized for reporting.

These semantic views power both the Consumer Intelligence and Brand Intelligence dashboards while reducing query complexity within Power BI.

---

### 7. Business Intelligence

Power BI consumes the semantic SQL layer to deliver two interactive analytical experiences:

- **Consumer Intelligence Dashboard** — Compare retailer prices, analyze historical price trends, and identify the best purchasing opportunities.
- **Brand Intelligence Dashboard** — Analyze customer demand, target-price expectations, retailer competitiveness, and watchlist trends to support pricing and promotional decisions.

## Database Design

DemandTrigger follows a layered database architecture that separates reference data, operational transactions, raw ingestion, historical storage, and semantic analytics.

This separation of concerns improves maintainability, simplifies ETL processing, and enables scalable analytics while keeping operational workloads independent from reporting workloads.

### Database Architecture

| Layer | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Reference Layer** | Stores relatively static master data such as products, brands, categories, retailers, and product listings. |
| **Operational Layer** | Captures user activity including watchlists, target prices, notifications, and watchlist events. |
| **Raw Layer** | Stores unprocessed retailer data exactly as scraped from external websites. |
| **Core Business Layer** | Maintains validated historical price records that serve as the single source of truth for downstream processing. |
| **Semantic Analytics Layer** | Consists of SQL views optimized for business intelligence and reporting. |

### Core Tables

#### Reference Layer

- **brands** — Product manufacturers
- **categories** — Product categories
- **stores** — Supported retailers
- **products** — Master product catalog
- **product_listings** — Retailer-specific product mappings

---

#### Operational Layer

- **users** — Registered users
- **watchlists** — Active products being monitored
- **target_price_history** — Historical target price changes
- **watchlist_events** — Watchlist lifecycle events
- **notifications** — Notification history and delivery status

---

#### Raw Layer

- **raw_scrape_data** — Raw retailer pricing collected during scraping

---

#### Core Business Layer

- **price_history** — Historical validated pricing data

---

#### Serving Layer

- **latest_prices** *(SQL View)* — Most recent product price across retailers


### Design Principles

The database was designed around the following engineering principles:

- **Layered Architecture** — Separate operational, historical, and analytical workloads.
- **Historical Data Preservation** — Maintain complete pricing history instead of overwriting records.
- **Semantic Modeling** — Expose analytics-ready SQL views rather than querying transactional tables directly.
- **Modularity** — Allow new retailers and products to be integrated with minimal schema changes.
- **Scalability** — Support future expansion of retailers, notification channels, and analytics without redesigning the database.

## Data Platform Design
